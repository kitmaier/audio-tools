5-voice harmonization of arbitrary melody like in adam neely's video
alternatively, bass line under 4-voice harmony

'pitch class' music, where each note is represented by all its octaves at decreasing volume from middle C

3+1 schema following page 212 fig 6.4.1b

page 106 fig 3.11.3 four-chord minor-third semitone voice leading



instead of random walk (equal chance of +1/-1) try move random distance by steps in each direction


page 247 fig 7.4.2 random walk through key space
also page 251 fig 7.4.7

any todo's leftover in composition files

page 286 fig 8.5.3 chopin game dominant seventh chords descending by semitones
variation - follow a nonoverlapping path through each corner of the cube before exiting at the bottom
variation - lower a different note from the diminished chord so the root descends by thirds, fifths, etc
variation - occasionally skip a step


rotate through semitone-related four-voice dominant seventh chords
page 291 fig 8.5.10

droning 1-5 interval (possibly duplicated), melody of randomly generating in-scale notes, overall scale changing slowly (eg rotating between the 6 valid modes)

droning all the notes of a scale at sufficient intervals to avoid dissonance, slowly changing scale by close voice leading (why not bend between notes as well)

7-of-12 beat rhythm - page 335 fig 9.3.15


i can't explain / turn the page - mixolydian / dorian - page 341 fig 9.3.22

definition of jazz harmony and harmonic progression - pages 353+
root-position chords, "avoid" notes, ii-V-I, stack of thirds or fourths, descending fifths by semitone voice leading, repetition of the same chord progression
bass guitar line, piano left hand specific chord shapes, right hand improvised

complex harmony and one-note supertonic or tonic melody

that one rhythm from the video (bum, bah-bum, bum-bah)


pseudo-irish-ballad example but with 4/4 beat, still swing, two eight-note K notes between two eigth-note C notes

would be good to transition to being able to generate midi files without passing through the text file stage
would also be good to be able to break down and print out midi files as text
would also be good to unify code to either java or python

invert notes/chords/scale through the neutral third, swapping the 1 and 5, different sound but similar function
Major <-> Phrygian
Minor <-> Mixolydian
Lydian <-> Locrian
Dorian <-> Dorian


Try repeating the same arbitrary phrase but the last note is controlled to sound open and then resolved (eg 5 and then 1)
